// Answer-quality flags stamped by the Cortex backend (2026-09-03+). A stream
// that was the prompt-injection safe refusal carries `refused: true` on its
// content and done frames; a writer that hit its output-token cap sets
// `truncated: true` on the done frame. The non-streaming POST /api/ask response
// has the same two fields top-level. Older backends send neither — callers
// fall back to isRefusalText() on the answer text. Shared by the browser
// stream parser (src/lib/api.ts) and server routes (none yet — kept for parity with cortex-chat).
